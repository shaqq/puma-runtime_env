# Puma::RuntimeEnv

Puma plugin to update ENV vars at runtime.

## Usage

This gem on its own won't do much. You'll need an adapter to read your ENV vars from a source:

- [From k8s mounted secrets](https://github.com/shaqq/puma-runtime_env-k8s)
- ~ * Your awesome adapter here * ~

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'puma-runtime_env'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install puma-runtime_env
